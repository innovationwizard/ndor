# This is the homepage of my personal website.

https://ndor.co/

I don't need any service or function from it. 
Just a simple index page. 
It just needs to exist. 

Due to my personal nostalgia, 
I feel inclined to give it a 
retro or vintage look and feel. 
Nothing fancy. 
No ulterior motive. 
Just my personal delight. 

HTML/CSS should be enough. 
If inspiration strikes, 
I might add some Python/JavaScript,
but just for fun.
